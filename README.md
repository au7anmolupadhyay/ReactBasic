# React Basics Overview

In React, whenever the value of a state changes, the component **re-renders** itself with the updated values. This is one of the core principles of React, as it allows the user interface to stay in sync with the application's state.

## What I Will Learn:
- **Props** Props (short for "properties") are like parameters in a function. They are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, allowing you to dynamically inject values when the component is rendered.

- **Hooks**: Hooks are special functions that let you "hook into" React features, such as state management, side effects, and lifecycle methods, in functional components. Hooks like useState and useEffect enable you to add functionality to components without needing to convert them to class-based components.
 Hooks return two values in array: one has the same value of a hook and another sets the value (updates the value)

- **Components**: Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component is typically a JavaScript function or class that returns a part of the user interface. Components can be functional (using hooks) or class-based (using lifecycle methods and state). In simple terms, components are reusable units that encapsulate features or groups of features of your UI.
