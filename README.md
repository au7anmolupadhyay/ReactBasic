# React Basics Overview

In React, whenever the value of a state changes, the component **re-renders** itself with the updated values. This is one of the core principles of React, as it allows the user interface to stay in sync with the application's state.

## What I Will Learn:
- **Props**: The mechanism by which data is passed from a parent component to a child component.
- **Hooks**: Special functions that let you "hook into" React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
- **Components**: The building blocks of React applications. Components can either be stateful (with state) or stateless (without state).

I will continue updating this section as I learn more about React and its features.
