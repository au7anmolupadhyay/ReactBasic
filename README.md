# React Basics Overview

In React, whenever the value of a state changes, the component **re-renders** itself with the updated values. This is one of the core principles of React, as it allows the user interface to stay in sync with the application's state.

## What I Will Learn:
- **Props**: These are like parameters in the function which can dynamically inject the values when invoked.
- **Hooks**: Special functions that let you "hook into" React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
- **Components**: The building blocks of React applications. In layman terms these are nothing but functions (features/group of features).
